The FuXi.Rete.Network.Network class supports [externally defined actions](http://www.w3.org/TR/rif-prd/#Execute).  In particular, for each terminal BetaNode (the beta node associated with the firing of a particular rule) in a Network instance, there is an [executeAction](http://code.google.com/p/fuxi/source/browse/lib/Rete/BetaNode.py#535) attribute that is a mapping from a (ground) RDF triple to a tuple of (**override**,**executeAction**) where **executeAction** is a function with the following signature:

def someExecuteAction(_tNode_, _inferredTriple_, _token_, _binding_, debug = False)

and **override** is a boolean value [indicating](http://code.google.com/p/fuxi/source/browse/lib/Rete/Network.py#527) whether the custom action will perform _all_ of the production duties (bypassing the inference of triples, etc.).  The first parameter passed in is the terminal node, the second is None if **override** is True or the inferred triple otherwise, token is the fully instantiated [token](http://code.google.com/p/fuxi/source/browse/lib/Rete/BetaNode.py#146), and binding is the [solution mapping](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/#defn_sparqlSolutionMapping) associated with the fully instantiated token as a dictionary of rdflib terms (or None if **override** is True).  The custom action can then use these parameters to implement its behavior.

Externally defined actions can be registered via the [FuXi.Rete.Network.Network.registerReteAction](http://code.google.com/p/fuxi/source/browse/lib/Rete/Network.py#643) method.
